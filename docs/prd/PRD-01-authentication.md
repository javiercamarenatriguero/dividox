# PRD-01 · Authentication

**Status:** Draft
**Platform:** Android · iOS · Desktop (KMP)
**User Stories:** DVX-US-001 · DVX-US-002 · DVX-US-003 · DVX-US-004

## Overview

Authentication is the entry gate to DiviDox. It covers user identity: creating an account, signing in with credentials or a third-party provider, recovering a forgotten password, and signing out. All flows must be seamless across Android, iOS, and Desktop.

---

## Problem Statement

Users need a secure and frictionless way to access their personal portfolio data from any supported platform. The authentication layer must protect sensitive financial information while minimising the steps required to reach the Dashboard.

---

## Goals

- Allow users to create an account with email/password.
- Allow returning users to sign in with email/password or Google OAuth.
- Allow users to recover access when they forget their password.
- Ensure the back stack is cleared after any successful authentication so the user cannot navigate back to the Login screen.

| # | Requirement |

| 10 | Clear the error banner automatically when the user begins editing any field. |
| 11 | Provide a "Continue with Google" outlined button that launches the native Google OAuth flow. |
| 12 | On Google OAuth success, navigate to Dashboard and clear the back stack. |
| 13 | On Google OAuth failure, show an inline error message below the button. |
| 14 | Provide a "Forgot Password" text link that navigates to the Password Recovery screen. |

### FR-01-02 · Create Account Screen

---

## Error & Edge Cases

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Network unavailable during Sign In | Show error banner: "No internet connection. Please try again." |
| Google OAuth cancelled by user | Dismiss OAuth sheet; no error shown. |
| Google OAuth account not linked to a DiviDox account | Offer the user to create a new account with the Google email pre-filled. |
| Session token expired while app is backgrounded | On next foreground, redirect to Login silently. |
| User attempts to navigate back after successful login | Back navigation is blocked (back stack cleared). |

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Passwords must never be stored or logged in plain text on device or server.
- Authentication tokens must be stored in the platform secure store (Android Keystore / iOS Keychain / Desktop secure storage).
- Biometric re-authentication (see PRD-08) integrates with this layer for app-launch protection.
- All auth network calls must timeout after 10 seconds with an appropriate error message.

---

## Out of Scope (v1)

- Email verification after account creation.
- Apple Sign In (iOS only).
- Two-factor authentication (2FA).
- Social providers beyond Google (Facebook, Twitter, etc.).

---

## Open Questions

- Should we enforce a minimum password strength (length, complexity) on the Create Account screen?
- Should the "Forgot Password" flow be entirely email-based or support in-app OTP as well?
